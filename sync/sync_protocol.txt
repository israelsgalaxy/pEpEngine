1.1 Sender signing

The key with which the sender of the message is signing. In case of trusted
messages this is signalled within the encrypted message. This is signalled by
by opt_field pEp-sender-sign, which is not reflected to the outer message.

Transports can opt to use HMAC or OMAC instead of digital signatures.

1.1 Transport signing

Keys with which others and not the sender are signing a message.

1.1 Sender Group key

This key is a sender signing key, which is used to update the group. If it is
reset the group breaks.
