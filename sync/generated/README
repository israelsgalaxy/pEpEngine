Code is generated here before beeing copied to /src during build process.

This code is intended to be commited and reviewed, while the original files 
in src/ aren't tracked in mercurial (.hgignore). 

Generated code must be generated out of source code systematically at build,
since generation could be influenced by build environment and parameters.

Depending on build host, version control tool or unharchiving tool, generated
files timestamp may prevent re-generation. They must then be excluded from repo.
