NAME
       gpg - OpenPGP encryption and signing tool

SYNOPSIS
       gpg [--homedir dir] [--options file] [options] command [args]

DESCRIPTION
       gpg  is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool
       to provide digital encryption and signing services  using  the  OpenPGP
       standard.  gpg features complete key management and all bells and whis‐
       tles you can expect from a decent OpenPGP implementation.

       This is the standalone version of gpg.  For desktop use you should con‐
       sider  using gpg2  ([On some platforms gpg2 is installed under the name
       gpg]).

RETURN VALUE
       The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least a signature
       was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.
