So this is a very exciting MIME mail. Yay!

Hi Bob. Is Eve listing in on our phone calls again? Mallory said so, but
he's always up to something, and I never know what to believe. He's
certainly no Trent.

Not as suspicious as Victor, though, always wanting my ID. Meh.

Tell Carol and Dave I said hi, and let's all invite Edmundo over to play
cards sometime.
