The memoryhole mails here correspond to the memoryhole corpus at http://modernpgp.org/memoryhole/corpus/ and should be used for checking memoryhole compliance. (Also, they're a way to reverse engineer empty parts of the spec). These are part of the examples specification guidance and are included for the repository for testing purposes only. The actual emails have been extracted and are in memoryhole_[A-H].eml in this directory.

Some of these will have to be changed by us to have keys we can actually use to decrypt the contents for testing, but the descriptions below of those emails tell us what they should contain:

Contents

    A: alternative text/html message with embedded header, signed
    B: alternative text/html message with embedded header, unsigned
    C: alternative text/html message with embedded header, signed, with Subject tampered
    D: alternative text/html message with embedded header, encrypted+unsigned
    E: alternative text/html message with embedded header, encrypted+signed
    F: headers in top-level MIME object: signed plaintext email
    G: headers in top-level MIME object: signed multipart email
    H: headers in top-level MIME: tampered subject and from

Email F:

headers in top-level MIME object: signed plaintext email

This message demonstrates including the memoryhole headers inside the
top-level MIME object. The signed Subject and From are headers of the
text/plain part, rather than having their own rfc822-headers part.

└┬╴multipart/signed 1242 bytes (Subject: headers in top-level MIME object: signed plaintext email)
 ├─╴text/plain 207 bytes (Subject: headers in top-level MIME object: signed plaintext email)
 └─╴application/pgp-signature 455 bytes


Email G:

headers in top-level MIME object: signed multipart email

This message demonstrates including the memoryhole headers inside the
top-level MIME object. The signed Subject and From are headers of the
multipart/alternative part, rather than having their own
rfc822-headers part.

└┬╴multipart/signed 1566 bytes (Subject: headers in top-level MIME object: signed multipart email)
 ├┬╴multipart/alternative 684 bytes (Subject: headers in top-level MIME object: signed multipart email)

Email H:

headers in top-level MIME: tampered subject and from

This email demonstrates including the memoryhole headers inside the
top-level MIME object. The signed Subject and From are headers of the
text/plain part, rather than having their own rfc822-headers part.

This email has been tampered with. It was originally sent by Winston,
who signed the body (including the memoryhole headers). Eve has
fiddled with the From and Subject headers in-flight.

└┬╴multipart/signed 1416 bytes (Subject: headers in top-level MIME: tampered subject and from)
 ├─╴text/plain 393 bytes (Subject: headers in top-level MIME: subject restored to original)
 └─╴application/pgp-signature 455 bytes
