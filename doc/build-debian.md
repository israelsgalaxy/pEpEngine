## libetpan
pEp Engine requires libetpan with a set of patches that have not been upstreamed yet.

~~~
mkdir -p ~/code/libetpan
git clone https://github.com/fdik/libetpan ~/code/libetpan

Edit the build configuration to your needs in `Makefile.conf`, or create a `local.conf` that sets any of the make variables documented in `Makefile.conf`. All the default values for the build configuration variables on each platform are documented in `default.conf`.

If a dependency is not found in your system's default include or library paths, you will have to specify the according paths in a make variable. Typically, this has to be done at least for YML2, libetpan and asn1c.

For a more detailed explanation of the mechanics of these build configuration files, and overriding defaults, see the comments in `default.conf`.

Below is a sample `./local.conf` file, for orientation.

~~~
PREFIX=$(HOME)/engine/build
SYSTEM_DB=$(PREFIX)/share/pEp/system.db

YML2_PATH=$(HOME)/yml2

ETPAN_LIB=-L$(HOME)/libetpan/build/lib
ETPAN_INC=-I$(HOME)/libetpan/build/include

ASN1C=$(HOME)/asn1c/build/bin/asn1c
ASN1C_INC=-I$(HOME)/asn1c/build/share/asn1c
~~~

The engine is built as follows:

~~~
make all
make db
~~~

The unit tests can be run without the engine library being installed, however `system.db` must be installed:

~~~
make -C db install
~~~

Since `system.db` rarely changes, its installation is not needed for every build.

Tests can be compiled and executed with the following commands:

~~~
make -C test compile
make test
~~~
