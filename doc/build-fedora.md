# Build instructions for Fedora 31

# Installing package dependencies

~~~
# Version control
dnf install -y mercurial git

# build dependencies (YML2, libetpan, asn1c)
dnf install -y python-lxml automake libtool autoconf

# build-essentials equivalent for rpm based systems
dnf groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
dnf install -y g++

# other engine dependencies (uuid, gpg, sqlite, asn1c)
dnf install -y libuuid-devel gpgme-devel libsqlite3x-devel libsqlite3x sqlite asn1c
~~~

# Installing unpackaged dependencies
## YML2

~~~
mkdir -p ~/code/yml2
hg clone https://pep.foundation/dev/repos/yml2/ ~/code/yml2
~~~

## libetpan (pEp Engine requires libetpan with a set of patches that have not been upstreamed yet)

~~~
mkdir -p ~/code/libetpan
git clone https://github.com/fdik/libetpan ~/code/libetpan
cd ~/code/libetpan
mkdir ~/code/libetpan/build
./autogen.sh --prefix="$HOME/code/libetpan/build"
make
make install
~~~

# pEp Engine

~~~
mkdir -p ~/code/pep-engine
hg clone https://pep.foundation/dev/repos/pEpEngine/ ~/code/pep-engine
cd ~/code/pep-engine
hg update sync
mkdir ~/code/pep-engine/build
~~~

Edit the build configuration to your needs in `Makefile.conf`, or create a `local.conf` that sets any of the make variables documented in `Makefile.conf`. All the default values for the build configuration variables on each platform are documented in `Makefile.conf`.

If a dependency is not found in your system's default include or library paths, you will have to specify the according paths in a make variable. Typically, this has to be done at least for YML2, and libetpan.

For a more detailed explanation of the mechanics of these build configuration files, and overriding defaults, see the comments in `Makefile.conf`.

Below is a sample `./local.conf` file, for orientation.

PER_MACHINE_DIRECTORY=$(PREFIX)/share/pEp

YML2_PATH=$(HOME)/code/yml2

## Building
The engine is built as follows:

~~~
make all
make db
~~~

## Installation

~~~
make dbinstall
make install
~~~

## Testing (optional)

TODO: Instructions for dependencies (see also ../test/README.md)

The unit tests can be run without the engine library being installed, however `system.db` must be installed:

~~~
make dbinstall
~~~

Since `system.db` rarely changes, its installation is not needed for every build.

Tests can be compiled and executed with the following commands:

~~~
make -C test compile
make test
~~~
