We pâ‰¡p Engine authors wish to thank:

* Tom St Denis and the other authors of the excellent LibTomCrypt, from which we
  reused the RIPEMD-160 hash implementation (while we are aware that the library
  is in the public domain and an acknowledgement is not required we still wish
  to freely express our gratitude);

* the authors of libetpan;

* the authors of asn1c;

* [likely other people we are forgetting].
